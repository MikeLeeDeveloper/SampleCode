Description: 
	Demonstrate the following topics:
	1.  Unpivot dataset into normalized data.
	2.  Dynamic query that will pivot normalized data 
		and scale to any changes to the object's definition.
		
Note:
	Normalizing data allow fields to be added to objects without modifying existing table structures. 
	Pivoting normalized data to a human readable format requires an explicit declaration of all fields.
	Dynamic queries allow reports of pivoted normalized data to scale to the current object definition 
	without developer intervention. (It's a query that writes itself)
