Description:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This batch file allows Windows Scheduler to execute Python3 files.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also open this in PowerShell to easily debug Python3 programs\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without	the use of an IDE. Powershell does not close the terminal after\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completion so any outputs or errors will persist. The terminal can also\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be placed in a fixed location on your monitor for easy access.
<br /><br />
Instructions:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Place RunPython.bat in same the directory as the python file to run\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Verify the python file you want to run is named the same as the directory\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or as "Program.py" (Case Sensitive)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Right click inside the directory and click "Open PowerShell window here"\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Type in .\RunPython.bat\
<br /><br />
Note:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To run again, navigate previous commands using the up and down arrow keys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type "clear" to clear terminal
